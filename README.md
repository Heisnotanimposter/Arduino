# Autonomous 2-Wheel Robot Project

## Overview
This project is an autonomous 2-wheel robot designed to navigate environments independently. It utilizes microwave sensors for obstacle avoidance, ensuring safe and efficient movement through its surroundings. The robot features Bluetooth connectivity for communication and control, and it can connect over HTTPS to a user's smartphone, allowing for remote monitoring and operation.

## Key Features
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Uses microwave sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Enables communication and control through a Bluetooth module.
- **HTTPS Connection**: Allows for remote interaction with the robot via a user's smartphone.
- **Motor Control**: Manages the robot's movement with precise motor control.

## Project Structure
- `.gitattributes` & `.DS_Store`: Git and system files.
- `Embeddedmain.py`: The main script running on the robot, coordinating its operations.
- `ble_advertising.py`: Manages Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertising for discovery by other devices.
- `bluetooth_module.py`: Handles Bluetooth communication, including pairing and data exchange.
- `distance_measure.py`: Interacts with the microwave sensor for distance measurement and obstacle detection.
- `motor_test.py`: Tests and calibrates the motors controlling the robot's wheels.
- `wifi_module.py`: Manages the WiFi connection for HTTPS communication with the smartphone app.
